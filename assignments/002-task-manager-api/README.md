## Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Task Manager API project: 

1. Introduction:
   - Purpose: The purpose of this API is to provide functionality for managing a todo list.
   - Scope: The API will handle tasks such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks in the todo list.

2. Functional Requirements:
   - The API should allow users to create a new task with a title and optional description.
   - Users should be able to retrieve a list of all tasks in the todo list.
   - Users should be able to update a task's title or description.
   - Users should be able to delete a task from the todo list.

3. Non-functional Requirements:
   - The API should be implemented using Express.js and Node.js.
   - The API should use JSON for request and response payloads.
   - The API should handle errors and return appropriate status codes and error messages.
   - The API should be secure and protect against unauthorized access or data manipulation.
   - The API should be well-documented, including information on endpoints, request/response formats, and error handling.

4. API Endpoints:
   - `GET /tasks`: Retrieves a list of all tasks in the todo list.
   - `POST /tasks`: Creates a new task with the provided title and optional description.
   - `GET /tasks/:taskId`: Retrieves a specific task by its ID.
   - `PATCH /tasks/:taskId`: Updates the title and/or description of a specific task.
   - `DELETE /tasks/:taskId`: Deletes a specific task from the todo list.

5. Data Model:
   - Task:
     - `id` (string): The unique identifier of the task.
     - `title` (string): The title of the task.
     - `description` (string): The description of the task (optional).

6. Security (Ignored):
   - User authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented to ensure only authorized users can perform CRUD operations on the tasks.
   - Use appropriate security measures like HTTPS, input validation, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
