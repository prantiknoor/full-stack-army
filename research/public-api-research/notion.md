# Notion API 

## URL Structure

Base URL - `https://api.notion.com`

## Versioning

Versioning is done on URL. It is after base URL.
```

```

## Authentication

They used **API Key** for authentication. **API Key** is passed through *request header*.

  -H 'Notion-Version: 2022-06-28' \

```

## Resource Naming Convention

They have been following REST principles for resource naming. They use plural noun for collections. For example:

- `https://api.notion.com/v1/pages`
- `https://api.notion.com/v1/users`

For individual item, they used `{BASE_URL}/v1/pages/:pageId` format.

## Error handling

They have proper error handling mechanism. They pass detail error message.

```json
{
  "object": "error",
  "status": 429,
  "code": "rate_limited",
  "message": "You have been rate limited. Please try again in a few minutes."
}
```

## Pagination

Pagination is done by **cursor**. For example:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "results": [],
  "next_cursor": "59833787-2cf9-4fdf-8782-e53db20768a5",
  "has_more": false,
